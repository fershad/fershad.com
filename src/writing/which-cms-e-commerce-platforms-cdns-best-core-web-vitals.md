The SISTRIX team have compiled a really detailed look at 18.5 million domains and how they stack up against Google Core Web Vitals metrics. You can [read their full study here](https://www.sistrix.com/blog/core-web-vitals-wix-vs-wordpress-shopify-vs-shopware-whats-fastest).

## Summary

The report provides some really interesting categorised analysis too - especially looking at various CMS offerings & e-commerce applications. Some results are surprising but on the whole the message is that there's no secret combination of technologies that guarantee great web performance results.

- WordPress is the 2nd poorest performing CMS, while WooCommerce (a WordPress plugin) is the worst performing e-commerce platform. That's not surprising considering WordPress fundamentally allows non-technical creatives to put together complex websites.
- Popular cloud CMS platforms like Wix and Squarespace lag behind other cloud CMS providers in performance.
- AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) isn't the most performant technology, despite being heavily pushed by Google.
- Fastly is by far the best performing of the CDNs that were called out in this study.
- Despite Google announcing that they'll be focusing on mobile first indexing, performance on mobile devices still lags behind desktop.
