archiveNote: After a couple of years, I decided to stop publishing the Optimised newsletter. Instead, I'm publishing everything to this blog.

On October 16th I'll be kicking off [**Optimised**](https://optimised.email), a fortnightly email newsletter focused on website performance. I'll be diving into what it is, why it matters, and ways you can address performance issues on your own websites. There'll be a mix of content for both business minded and technical readers alike.  
  
Optimised won't just be a one-way street though. I hope it can be a chance for us to start a conversation. I'd love to hear, and share, your own website performance questions, and stories.

Head over to the [Optimised landing page](https://optimised.email) to find out more, and subscribe!
