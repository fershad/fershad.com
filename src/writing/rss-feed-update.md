This post is a heads up for those of you who subscribe to my blog (fershad.com/writing) via RSS.

I'm close to completing a website redesign, and am hoping to have it all merged into the main website later this week. As part of that, I've also decided to move my notes blog from a separate subdomain [qt.fershad.com](<https://qt.fershad.com> onto my main site. With this change, I'll be consolidating both my (ir)regular posts and notes into the RSS feed for this blog (the one you're subscribed to - [https://fershad.com/feed.xml](https://fershad.com/feed.xml)).

## Actions you can take

I'm apologising in advance if this causes a tonne of old content from me to end up reappearing in your RSS feed.

With the extra content that will be published on this blog going forwards, I want to give folks the option to choose what writing they receive in their RSS readers. With that in mind, I'm creating two extra feeds in addition to the main one. So, once the new site is online, you can:

- Stay subscribed to the main feed at [https://fershad.com/feed.xml](https://fershad.com/feed.xml) to get all the stuff I publish.
- Subscribe to the new Posts feed at [https://fershad.com/feed-posts.xml](https://fershad.com/feed-posts.xml) to receive my longer form content - mostly focused on web sustainability but with some change ups thrown in occasionally.
- Subscribe to the new Notes feed at [https://fershad.com/feed-notes.xml](https://fershad.com/feed-notes.xml) to get the short notes, quick thoughts, monthly recaps, and link posts that I'm hoping to publish more of in 2025.

Of course, if you love duplication then you can subscribe to all three though I'd advise against that.

## How will you now when the new site is online?

I'll blog about it, of course!
