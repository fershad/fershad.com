At Green Web Foundation, we're kicking off a project which we're calling Grid-aware Websites. If you're a regular to this website, you know that in the past I've made some changes to [make this site "carbon-aware"](https://fershad.com/writing/making-this-website-carbon-aware/). This project will build on that concept.

We plan to build an open-source package that exposes APIs so developers can retrieve information about the energy grid their users are on, so that they can make their front-ends grid-aware. In the early stages, we're looking to create code and examples that work on CDN edge functions, however eventually the aim is for this code to work with most CDN edge runtimes, and server-side JS frameworks.

> For this project, weâ€™re setting out to extend this learning and build out something new: **easy to adopt open-source code that allows developers to quickly make their website grid-aware**. This code will build upon the carbon-aware ideas of websites such as Branch, and expose approachable APIs that developers can hook into to retrieve information about the energy grid their users are on, so that they can make their frontends grid-aware.

P.S. You bet I'll be dogfooding this project on this here website. Stay tuned.
