{% callout "Have a project idea?" %}
I work with the [Green Web Foundation](https://thegreenwebfoundation.org), and currently do not take on individual freelance projects.

If you've got a project that you want to work on, [contact us at the Green Web Foundation](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/services/). That way, you'll have access to not only me but to the wealth of knowledge that [Michelle, Hannah, Katrin, Lima, and Chris](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/about#team) bring to the table!
