File this one under _"absolutely wild charts"_.

![A dual bar chart titled "Clustered consumption" showing data center electricity usage across U.S. states in 2023. The chart has two metrics: total electricity consumption in TWh (shown in blue bars) and percentage of state's total electricity consumption (shown in red bars). Virginia leads with 33.9 TWh (25.6% of state total), followed by Texas at 21.8 TWh (4.6%). California ranks third at 9.3 TWh (3.7%). The chart displays data for 15 states total, with Nevada having the lowest consumption at 3.4 TWh but representing 8.7% of state electricity use. The subtitle notes 'Data centers already consume a quarter of Virginia's total electricity.'
