This is wild. Data from Ireland shows that the electricity consumption of data centers in 2022 was the same as all the energy used by urban dwellings in the country.

<img src="../../public/img/irelandDC2022.png" alt="Data Centres Metered Electricity Consumption 2022: % of metered electricity consumed by data centres, 5% in 2015, 14% in 2021, 18% in 2022; % of metered electricity consumed by urban dwellings, 21% in 2021, 18% in 2022; % of metered electricity consumed by rural dwellings, 12% in 2021, 10% in 2022">

The infographic above comes from the [Central Statistics Office of Ireland (CSO)](https://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-dcmec/datacentresmeteredelectricityconsumption2022/).

It's unbelievable to see the increase in electricity consumption for data centers over time. A 31% increase from 2021 to 2022, and a 400% increase from 2015 to 2022. That's not sustainable growth, and it kind of makes me question what we hear about improvements in the efficiency of data center hardware.

I hope the CSO keep publishing this data yearly. It'll be very interesting to see how it trends, especially with data for 2023 that would capture the LLM, AI, ChatGPT boom.
