I recently read an [article on the BBC website](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz93ge90dywo) about a new Taiwanese TV drama that centers on a Chinese invasion of the island. One particular line in the article really ticked me off.

> Beijing has long viewed self-ruled Taiwan as part of its territory, vowing to "reunify" with it some day while not ruling out the use of force.

Plus a line further down the article ...

> Any formal declaration [by Taiwan of independence] as such would be considered as an act of war by Beijing.

Lines like these are pretty common whenever the Western media talk about Taiwan. There's a constant reference to cross-strait conflict - which is probably why every time my Mum calls me she's asking if it's safe here.

What shits me about statements like the one above is that it plays into the Chinese Communist Party's desired narrative that _any_ action they take against Taiwan would be the result of Taiwan being naughty. Western media outlets need stop playing into this narritive. And I hope that next time you, dear reader, see a line like this in an article you'll also be able to understand it for what it is.

Because, to be clear, there's no need for Taiwan to make any declarations. For all intense an purposes Taiwan is already a sovereign state under international definitions. It's just that the overwhelming majority of the world lack the balls to recognise that formally. Nathan Attrill's article [Every day is Independence Day in Taiwan](https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/every-day-is-independence-day-in-taiwan/) is a good read on this topic.

Oh, and you really should come visit Taiwan. Experience it for yourself. You won't be disappointed!
