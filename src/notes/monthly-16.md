The start of April was really rushed, with a lot of different things going on a work, a conference talk to prepare for, and some more travel. Things thankfully slowed down in the back half of the month.

## April 2025

🇸🇬 **GreenIO Singapore**. For the second year in a row I was able to attend the GreenIO Singapore conference. Gael, Thibaud, and the team put on a great event which showcased some great examples of digital sustainability being put into practice globally and in Asia. The digital sustainability events space is very EU heavy, so having a conference like GreenIO in Asia provides a great opportunity for the community here to interact and meet in person. While I was in Singapore, I had the chance to catch up with some folks from the Singapore GovTech team who are working with CO2.js on a few initiatives.

👨‍🏫 **First time workshop lead**. My Green Web Foundation colleagues Katrin and Chris have been running regular online workshop that give an introduction to estimating digital carbon emissions. In April, I was able to step up and lead one of these workshops for the first time. It was my first ever time facilitating something like that, and I'm grateful for the support Katrin and Chris gave during the session. We're running these workshops regularly through the year at times that should make them accessible to folks around the globe. If you're interested in improving your literacy of digital sustainability and digital carbon estimation, [you should attend one](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/services/estimating-digital-carbon-emissions-workshop/)!

🆕 **Talking about Grid-aware Websites for the first time**. At the GreenIO Singapore conference, I had the chance to speak about the Grid-aware Websites project we've been working on for the very first time. It was great to get some feedback on the ideas we're developing, and hear from folks about what they might like to see too. There's no recording of the talk, but you can check out [my slides here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lU0EmRl4OF322fXpUF9wxES8c2rLMWFe7txqi-867Tw/edit?usp=drive_link).

### Tracking start, stop, continue targets

These are my current [Start, stop, continue items for 2025](/notes/start-stop-continue-2025/).

#### **Start**

- _Tracking habits daily_: 😔 Nope.
- _Carrying a water bottle with me_: 😄 Yes! But like Sydney, Singapore does a pretty poor job of providing hydration stations.
- _Drinking a glass of water first thing in the morning_: 😄 Yes! Daily habit unlocked~
- _Making a weekly "Links & Listens" list_: 😔 Nope. I think I'll end up making a "links" page on this site that will be a place to put stuff as I come across it.
- _Cooking more regularly_: 😔 Nope.

#### **Stop**

- _Reaching for sugary (fizzy) drinks_: 😄 Yes. Been pretty good with this even as Summer starts to hit in Taiwan.
- _Waiting for things to be perfect before releasing them_: 😔 Nope. Too busy to be building any side projects. But I do have a few blog posts in draft that are dragging on longer than expected.

#### **Continue**

- _Trying to get Touch into more local schools in Taiwan_: 😄 Continuing conversations around this.
- _Getting in a 20-30 minute walk during the day_: 😄 Yes! Unless it's raining or I've cycled that day.
