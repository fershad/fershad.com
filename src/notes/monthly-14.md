February felt like a really good month, culminating in [RightsCon 2025](https://www.rightscon.org/) being held in Taipei.

## February 2025

ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¼ **RightCon 2025 in Taipei**. The last week of February was filled with meeting a lot of great people and learning about some really interesting projects. RightsCon was a huge conference, and certainly was much bigger than I expected. It was made even better by having Michelle Thorn, my colleague at the Green Web Foundation, in town for the event. A couple of the projects that I learnt about through various conversations were [Open Terms Archive](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/opentermsarchive.org), and a really interesting project that's trying to assess the [resilience of Taiwan's internet](https://github.com/irvin/digital-service-resilience) in the event of multiple submarine cables failing.

There wasn't much else of note during February. I guess the month felt good because it was generally uneventful.

### Tracking start, stop, continue targets

These are my current [Start, stop, continue items for 2025](/notes/start-stop-continue-2025/).

#### **Start**

- _Tracking habits daily_: ðŸ˜” Nope. Didn't do this for the whole month.
- _Carrying a water bottle with me_: ðŸ˜„ Yes!
- _Drinking a glass of water first thing in the morning_: ðŸ˜„ Yes, getting this done most days.
- _Making a weekly "Links & Listens" list_: ðŸ˜„ Yes! Skipped a week during the month, but happy with the general consistency.
- _Cooking more regularly_: ðŸ˜” Nope.

#### **Stop**

- _Reaching for sugary (fizzy) drinks_: ðŸ˜„ Yes, stuck with this during February.
- _Waiting for things to be perfect before releasing them_: ðŸ˜„ Did well with this. Released the [Green Web Tracker](https://tracker.greenweb.org) project during the month.

#### **Continue**

- _Trying to get Touch into more local schools in Taiwan_: ðŸ˜„ Continuing conversations around this.
- _Getting in a 20-30 minute walk during the day_: ðŸ˜„ Yes! I reckon at least 6 out of 7 days as week I'm getting this done.
