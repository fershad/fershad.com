I'm stoked to be speaking at the Web Directions [Code](https://webdirections.org/code/) and [Code Leaders](https://webdirections.org/leaders/) conferences in Melbourne this June! I'll be there alongside of amazing people like Stephanie Eckles, Mandy Michael, Geoff Huntley and many many more!

My talks at both events will focus on the [Grid-aware Websites](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/tools/grid-aware-websites/) project that we're working on at the Green Web Foundation. I'm excited to introduce the project to a deverloper audience, and keen to get feedback on the work we've done so far. Beyond that, I'm also looking forward to introducing more folks in Australia to digital sustainability and the fact that we can actually take actions today which can reduce the impacts from our use of digital.

So if you're Down Under and can get to Melbourne on June 11 - 13, then I'd love to meet you at Code. And if you can't make it in person, the you can get access to the event live stream instead.

P.S. I'm also keen to watch the Swans play Richmond on June 7th, and the Storm v. Cowboys game on June 6th. If you're in Melbourne and keen for either then [get in touch](/contact)!
