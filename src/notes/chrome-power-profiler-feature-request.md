title: Let's get Power Profiling into Chromium DevTools
published: 2025-11-25

This morning I wrote about how back in 2014/15 we almost had [power profiling land in the Chromium DevTools](/writing/almost-chrome-power-profiler/).

Tonight, I've created a new ~~issue~~ feature request on crbug.com with the hope that it can get the ball rolling on getting power profiling into the Chromium DevTools within some timeframe that isn't tomorrow but also isn't never. Check it out at [*\[Feature request\] Power profiling to surface power and energy draw from browser and website use.*](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/463551849).

## Help this get traction

If you care about this and think it should be something that is in Chromium DevTools, please visit the issue using the link above and give it a **+1** (screenshot below). This help show that there is a desire for a broader community this kind of functionality to be part of DevTools.

![A screenshot of an issue on the crbug website, with the +1 button highlighted and the rest of the content greyed out.](../../public/img/blog/crbug_plus_one.jpg 'Use the +1 button on the crbug issue page to show that having power profiling in Chromium is important for you.')

Hopefully we're on the way to getting power profiling in multiple browsers. 🙏🏼
