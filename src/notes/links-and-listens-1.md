One of the things [I wanted to start doing regularly this year](https://fershad.com/notes/start-stop-continue-2025/#making-a-weekly-links-and-listens-list) was publishing a weekly "Links and listens" note. The purpose is to capture some of the really interesting content I've read or heard during the week, so that I can hopefully find it again in the future if I need to. This is the first of those notes. Perhaps a weekly cadence might be too ambitious, let's see how it goes.

### [Digital sustainability in WordPress](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/news/digital-sustainability-in-wordpress/)

This post by Hannah Smith, my colleague at the Green Web Foundation, captures our sentiments about this week's drama the Kingdom of ~~WordPress~~ Matt Mullenweg. The WordPress sustainability group was suddenly dissolved by Matt Mullenweg, apparently shortly after the learnt WordPress even had a group of *volunteers* working on sustainability in the WordPress community.

### [Things we learned out about LLMs in 2024](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/31/llms-in-2024/)

In the last few weeks, I've read a lot of year in review posts. [I even wrote on myself](https://fershad.com/writing/2024-in-review/). This one by Simon Willison is pretty much a must read for anyone who wants to be updated on what's happening in the realm of AI and LLMs. He covers a lot of ground, including making several points throughout about the neuance with which we should be thinking about AI, LLMs, and their environmental impacts.

> I think telling people that this whole field is environmentally catastrophic plagiarism machines that constantly make things up is doing those people a disservice, no matter how much truth that represents. There is genuine value to be had here, but getting to that value is unintuitive and needs guidance.

### [Progressive enhancement brings everyone in - The History of the Web](https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/the-inclusive-web-of-progressive-enhancement/)

This article about the history behind the concept of progressive enhancement on the web has really stuck with me. I've been thinking about progressive enhancement a fair bit in the context of [making this website grid aware](https://fershad.com/writing/making-this-website-grid-aware/), and our overall [Grid-aware Websites project](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/tools/grid-aware-websites/). At the moment, I "degrade" functionality on the site by removing certain bits of code whenever a user is visiting from a region where the electricity generated is coming from mostly fossil-fuels. But this post, and some of the feedback I've received about this site has got me thinking *how might I go about "progressively enhancing" the site instead for visitors who are on cleaner power grids and so can afford to take on the additional compute of some features?"

## Listens

I'm still working out an easy way to collect the interesting things I've listened to from Snipd, the podcast app I use. They don't have an API, or a web interface.

## [Reckoning: Frontend's Lost Decade | Alex Russell | performance.now() 2024](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0XwWVjQOmyg)

Alex Russell with a banger of a conference talk in which he explores the advantages of the web, and the challenges it has faced from other platforms, especially mobile, and how we can/should be taking action to create a future where the free and open web wins.
