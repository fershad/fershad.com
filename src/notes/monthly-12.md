Far out, where'd December go?

## December 2024

A month that felt like an absolute blur. I didn't do that much during December, so this'll be a short update. The highlight was [redesigning this website](/writing/new-year-new-look) & launching that onto the web.

### Tracking start, stop, continue targets

These are things [I set out to do more or less of in 2024](https://fershad.com/notes/start-stop-continue-2024/). I'm not big on habit tracking, so this "tracking" report is all just vibes.

#### **Start**

- _Going to the gym regularly:_ 😐 Nah, that's fallen right away post-World Cup
- _Doing 20k+ bike rides each week:_ 😐 No time + shitty weather.
- _Writing monthly reviews:_ Yep ⭐, you're reading it now.
- _Taking the cat outside the apartment:_ Nope ❎. Winter's here, so she wants to just sit on my lap all day.
- _Capturing thoughts in a notebook:_ 😐 No. 2025 ??

#### **Stop**

- _Sugary snacks:_ Yep ⭐. Though I need some way to curve the urge for an ice cream after lunch when I'm out for a walk.
- _Using my phone in bed:_ Kinda 😀. Been using the Boox Palma 2 a bit, but got carried away with website stuff & ended up having my laptop with me in bed a few times. Bad.

#### **Continue**

- _Taking regular breaks/vacations with Kay:_ 😀 We're planning our next trips - Australia in March next year for a family event.
- _Getting nerd-sniped by work stuff:_ Yes 😀. Building something for Green Web Foundation as we speak.
- _Following other folks on RSS:_ Kinda 😀. I've added a few more feeds to my list recently & culled a few feeds that I've not read in a long time.
- _Building a financial safety-net:_ Yes, started to invest a bit more.
