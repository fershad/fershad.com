A very late monthly this time. March was a really busy month that mixed family, work, and travel.

## March 2025

ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º **Climate Action Week Sydney 2025**. I was fortunate enough to attend the second Climate Action Week Sydney (CAW:SYD) at the start of March. It was a fantastic opportunity to share our Green Web Foundation work and tools. Thanks to support from some great people - Tim Prosser, Cita van Mierlo, and Caroline Rham - I was able to be part of two panel discussions and one workshop all focused on digital sustainability. It was also nice to get an insight into the sustainability landscape in Australia, especially with reporting requirements coming into effect this year.

ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º **Family time in Oz**. My sister got married at the end of March. I was originally coming to Sydney for that, and being able to join CAW:SYD was a bonus. The wedding was held in rural NSW, so it gave Kay and I an opportunity to spend a few days in the Blue Mountains and Mudgee on the way to the wedding. Katoomba and the towns of the Blue Mountains were really nice, and had a great sense of community which Sydney itself lacks.

ðŸ“· **Vintage cameras deluxe**. Mum asked me to go through a few draws at home to clear things out. Doing that uncovered three old film cameras (plus a few other digital ones) that my parents own. There was a Canon AV-1 from 1979 that my dad got in the USA during his first trip there. There was also an old Minolta camera that I vividly remember my parents taking using at holidays and special occasions.

### Tracking start, stop, continue targets

These are my current [Start, stop, continue items for 2025](/notes/start-stop-continue-2025/).

#### **Start**

- _Tracking habits daily_: ðŸ˜” Nope.
- _Carrying a water bottle with me_: ðŸ˜„ Yes! But bloody hell, Sydney could do with some more water refill points around the city. Every station train station (at least) should have one.
- _Drinking a glass of water first thing in the morning_: ðŸ˜„ Yes, getting this done most days.
- _Making a weekly "Links & Listens" list_: ðŸ˜” Nope. The backlog is getting pretty long now.
- _Cooking more regularly_: ðŸ˜” Nope.

#### **Stop**

- _Reaching for sugary (fizzy) drinks_: ðŸ˜„ Yes. The price of things in Australia helped.
- _Waiting for things to be perfect before releasing them_: ðŸ˜” Nope. Too busy to be building any side projects. But I do have a few blog posts in draft that are dragging on longer than expected.

#### **Continue**

- _Trying to get Touch into more local schools in Taiwan_: ðŸ˜„ Continuing conversations around this.
- _Getting in a 20-30 minute walk during the day_: ðŸ˜„ Yes! Did a lot of walking in Australia.
