title: I've added webmentions to this blog

I've been meaning to play around with this for a while now. Last night I had a bit of time and my fingers just started typing "Webmentions Eleventy" in the old search box. I came across this post from [Bob Monsour](https://bobmonsour.com/blog/adding-webmentions-to-my-site/#what-are-webmentions%3F) and away I went. It was pretty quick to get everything set up, and took a handful of hours this morning to get some styling in place too.

I've added likes, reposts, and mentions to the top of each post (if they exist). User photos can be shown for each using a toggle on the page. Comments should appear at the bottom of the post, but I've not received any in my feed so far, so I'm not sure how that'll work. There'll be a few rounds of iteration on the design as the year goes on I suppose.
