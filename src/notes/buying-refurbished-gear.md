Saving this link for my future self and anyone who comes across this post.

[Backmarket](https://www.backmarket.com/en-us) looks like a really solid place to visit if you're looking to replace some gadgets and don't mind having refurbished gear. Chris Adams, a colleague of mine at the Green Web Foundation purchased a refurbed M1 Macbook earlier this year from there, and it's been serving him very well since.
