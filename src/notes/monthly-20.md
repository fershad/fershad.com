August was a rare month for 2025, one where I was at home for the entire month!

## August 2025

🍰 **38 trips around the sun**. The highlight of August, as it is every year, was my birthday. I normally don't do too much to celebrate. This year, Kay and I went to a new vegan restaurant that has opened near home to try it out.

🏉 **3 week Touch tournament**. I organised a 3 week Touch tournament during the month. Since it's Summer here the temperatures during the day can be pretty intense, so we ran a night tournament. It was small, with only three teams registering, but it was great getting folks together playing some regular Touch.

### Tracking start, stop, continue targets

These are my current [Start, stop, continue items for 2025](/notes/start-stop-continue-2025/). I've made one change to the "Start", removing drinking a glass of water every morning (that's become habitual) and replaced it with a goal to get 2 days at the gym in each week for the rest of the year.

#### **Start**

- _Tracking habits daily_: 😔 Nope.
- _Carrying a water bottle with me_: 😄 Yes!
- _2 days at the gym each week_: 😔 Not yet. Started in September ~~
- _Making a weekly "Links & Listens" list_: 😔 Kinda. Not weekly, but I've got a [links page](/links) which I'm now updating infrequently.
- _Cooking more regularly_: 😔 Nope.

#### **Stop**

- _Reaching for sugary (fizzy) drinks_: 😔 Kinda. It's hard during a brutal Taiwan summer with 7-11 around every corner!
- _Not waiting for things to be perfect before releasing them_: 😄 Yes! Many a blog post have been published this month!

#### **Continue**

- _Trying to get Touch into more local schools in Taiwan_: 😔 Nope. Things feel through with a local school in central Taiwan. Hopefully there'll be an opportunity later this year.
- _Getting in a 20-30 minute walk during the day_: 😄 Yes!
