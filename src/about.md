{% callout "TL;DR" %}
I'm an Aussie who's called Taiwan home for over a decade. I'm a frontend developer, as well as a Touch Football player, referee, coach, and organiser. When at home I often serve as a sofa for my cat.

### Work

I work with the Green Web Foundation to create a just, equitable, open, fossil-free internet. There are three key parts to my role at the moment:

- **Coding** -  I work on building and maintaining several open-source projects for the foundations, mostly focused on helping frontend developers build more sustainable practices into the websites they build. Check out the [Projects](projects) page on this website to see what I've been up to.
- **Technical writing** - Working at the intersection of climate and technology can be really technical. One of the things I'm told I do well at is explaining technical concepts in a way that makes them easier for those who might not necessarily have a wealth of domain expertise to understand.
- **Verification** - The Green Web Foundation maintains an open dataset of hosting providers that we have verified as delivering their services using 100% green energy (or an equivalent means). I'm manage the verification review process, as well as coordinating the annual reverification of listed providers. Learn more about verification on [the Green Web Foundation website](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/tools/green-web-dataset/get-verified/).

You can find out about the other "professional stuff" I've done through my lifetime over on the hell site that is [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fershad/).

### Fun

When I'm not at my computer, I'm normally doing one of the things below:

- Playing with my cat.
- Cycling on the riversides and mountains around Taipei.
- Doing some photography. See some at [film.fershad.com](https://film.fershad.com).
- Playing Touch Football (Touch Rugby if you must).
- Refereeing at a Touch Football tournament.
- Coaching Touch Football.
- Organising the local Touch Football association.

You might have guessed that Touch Football plays a pretty big part in my life. I love the sport, and the friends it's given me all around the globe. I've been fortunate enough to both referee and play for Taiwan at an international level, including two Mixed Open World Cup campaigns (one as co-captain).
