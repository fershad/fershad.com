> If you’re not already a web developer though, it is a relatively expensive intervention – hiring a web developer to make your site more sustainable through front OR back end performance changes relies on you being able to:
>
> 1.  dedicate loads of time to learning all the techniques to become one, or
> 2.  hire a web developer with the required set of skills to apply them to your site, who are hard to find, and generally more expensive than developers who haven’t specialised like this
>
> Both of these are hard to justify with their short term returns vs the other things you’re expected to do when sustainability isn’t your main job.
