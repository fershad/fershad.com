> Environmental impacts from “AI” are often derided as being based off improbable forecasts of the future. But you can find any number of material, real and immediate impacts from the data centre boom happening right now. This is tactile stuff, and again, not what you would expect if these companies were delivering inert, energy-efficient services that ‘don’t harm the environment’.

> Tech companies have recognised how they need to evolve control of the public narrative around the products they provide, and so they’re successfully shifting the conversation towards consumer decisions rather than their own decisions.
