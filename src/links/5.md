I'd never heard of pace layering until reading this post by Chris Coyer. It makes a lot of sense, thinking about it, and it aligns with the way I've seen things work in a lot of spaces.

> I find this a helpful framework to think in sometimes. For instance, if you feel frustration at how quickly or slowly a particular technology moves, are you considering its place within the layers? Perhaps that speed is because it is part of a system that pressures it to be that way or it being that way is beneficial to the system as a whole. Even zoomed into browser technology, HTML not moving as fast as JavaScript feels like it could be mapped onto Pace Layers.
