I came across this piece as a side effect of some internet hot drama that I was passively watching from the sidelines. I like distinctions made for when we might choose to call something/someone out versus when it could make more sense to call them in.

> According to Thom (2015), calling out is when we publicly name the harm, often responding with strong emotions like anger, drawing the attention of others to the problem. Calling in is when we privately respond to the person and gently explain why their behaviour needs to change. Both of these strategies can be effective in holding people accountable, but it is important to consider what is happening in the situation and what result you would like to achieve.
