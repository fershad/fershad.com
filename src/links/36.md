> Bottom line: Feedback should be thoughtful, specific, grounded, and mutual. If you’re not doing it with intention, you’re not doing it right.

> Because the truth is, feedback can land hard. Even when it’s accurate. Even when it’s kind. Even when it’s necessary.

> And yet, it’s still one of the clearest forms of care we have. Especially when it’s offered with intention, received with curiosity, and held in an environment of trust. Feedback is not an attack. It’s a mirror. And the point isn’t to feel ashamed of what you see, it’s to adjust the lighting, stay open, and keep building.
