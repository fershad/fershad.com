Found myself nodding along to this short post about the uneven distribution of AI's benefits and "value creation". It's timely, especially with the AI Summit happening in Paris this week, and the release of a [Joint Statement on Limiting AI’s Environmental Impact](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/news/within-bounds-joint-statement-on-limiting-ais-environmental-impact/) which we (Green Web Foundation) and 100+ other organisations are signatories to.

> The two groups of actors that truly benefit from generative AI so far are 1) a dozen or so of big tech companies and 2) to a smaller degree, employers who might get some small efficiency gain out of their employees.
>
> It’s the opposite of the (long debunked) Trickle Down Economics of yesteryear: The financial value bubbles to the very top, and only trace amounts of the value capture happens anywhere below.
