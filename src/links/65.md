> Open source projects exist under a social contract between the maintainers who produce the software and the users who consume and who may contribute back to it. While maintainers do not *owe* anything to their users — to quote the popular MIT license “THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED ‘AS IS,’ WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND” — most maintainers do try to meet an implied social contract of the minimum expectations of an open source software project.
