> Our world is a collaborative endeavor. (Competition is Darwin-inspired and, together with property and scarcity, capitalism-affirming BS.) Collaboration requires trust. Trust requires truth—and truth requires trust. Just making and aggressively pushing on claims, like lobbyists and political extremists do, is untruthful and therefore undermines trust. Without trust and without truth, there’s ultimately no collaboration—and, ultimately, no world.
