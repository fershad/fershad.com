In the last few weeks, I've read a lot of year in review posts. [I even wrote on myself](https://fershad.com/writing/2024-in-review/). This one by Simon Willison is pretty much a must read for anyone who wants to be updated on what's happening in the realm of AI and LLMs. He covers a lot of ground, including making several points throughout about the nuance with which we should be thinking about AI, LLMs, and their environmental impacts.

> I think telling people that this whole field is environmentally catastrophic plagiarism machines that constantly make things up is doing those people a disservice, no matter how much truth that represents. There is genuine value to be had here, but getting to that value is unintuitive and needs guidance.
