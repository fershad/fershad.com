My colleague, Chris, shared this idea of "git scraping" to me around a small side-project I'm building at the Green Web Foundation. I vibe with the idea, and reckon it'd be a pretty neat way to track changes in a dataset over time. It's stored away in the back of my mind & hopefully I'll have something to use it on later this year.
