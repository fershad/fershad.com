> Deep Research has the same problem as every other generative AI product. These models don't *know* anything, and thus everything they do — even "reading" and "browsing" the web — is limited by their training data and probabilistic models that can say "this is an article about a subject" and posit their *relevance*, but not truly understand their contents. Deep Research repeatedly citing SEO-bait as a primary source proves that these models, even when grinding their gears as hard as humanely possible, are exceedingly mediocre, deeply untrustworthy, and ultimately useless.

> These men are constantly lying as a means of sustaining hype, never actually discussing ***the products they sell in the year 2025***, because then they'd have to say "what if a chatbot, a thing you already have, was more expensive?"
