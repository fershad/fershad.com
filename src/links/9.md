Laurie Voss reflects on his experiences with AI, where it shines, and where it falls short of expectations. I vibe with his sentiments that Language Models (LMs) at the moment are suited to tasks are based on summarising text. I've found that's increasingly all I'm using them for.

> There is no way to get an LLM to perform the thought necessary to write something for you. You have to do the thinking. To get an LLM to write something good you have to give it a prompt so long you might as well have just written the thing yourself.
