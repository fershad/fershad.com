> We bring tools in to reduce cognitive load so we can “focus on higher-level work.” Good intention. Wrong model. Abilities do not sit in cold storage while a tool handles them. They weaken with disuse. The less you do a thing, the harder it becomes to do that thing, and the faster your confidence plummets.

> The fear is not that AI becomes sentient. The fear is that humans become inert.
