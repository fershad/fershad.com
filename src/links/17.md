Om Malik writes about the growth of fixed connection broadband availability around the globe, which now reaches 1.5 billion people. He also looks at what lies ahead with caution as the next billion people connect with fast fixed broadband connections.

> Looking ahead, the challenge isnâ€™t simply about reaching the next billion connections. The world faces a more complex problem: preventing a new form of digital bifurcation where advanced markets pull even further ahead. If artificial intelligence (AI) becomes a core part of all digital experiences, the lack of connectivity will leave a large swath of humanity behind, simply because they lack access to better digital tools.
