This article about the history behind the concept of progressive enhancement on the web has really stuck with me. I've been thinking about progressive enhancement a fair bit in the context of [making this website grid aware](https://fershad.com/writing/making-this-website-grid-aware/), and our overall [Grid-aware Websites project](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/tools/grid-aware-websites/). At the moment, I "degrade" functionality on the site by removing certain bits of code whenever a user is visiting from a region where the electricity generated is coming from mostly fossil-fuels. But this post, and some of the feedback I've received about this site has got me thinking \*how might I go about "progressively enhancing" the site instead for visitors who are on cleaner power grids and so can afford to take on the additional compute of some features?"
