Max Böck has a dig at the different AI "enhancements" users are having aggressively shoved down their throats. Often they're being added to products and services that the users are already used to using, and the users are being forced to opt-out (and sometimes that's even hard to do). More often than not, the quality of these AI "enhancements" detract from what once was a useful product.

> I get that it’s not as fun to build “a faster horse”. To just make the thing you already have better, more reliable, more helpful. It doesn’t get your shareholders excited, and it doesn’t make you look like a visionary genius.
