Thibaud wrote this reflection on his involvement in our Grid-aware Websites project. I'm so glad to be able to lean on the guidance of our advisory group for this project. As as developer, I'm just like write some code, make some cool demos, and success! But having the advisory group to bounce ideas off, and get feedback from, opens our eyes to other things we should be considering - like the business case for making grid-aware changes to a website. Also, I really like this line from Thibaud, and am hoping to work it as a way to frame the Grid-aware Websites project.

> Websites, and the web platform generally, are excellently suited to adapt to user needs (color themes, font sizes, responsive, etc).
