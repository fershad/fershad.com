To improve this, readers should focus on later chapters, authors should provide value early, and designers should create systems that highlight important content throughout.",

Our flight was short and cheap and the seats didn’t have TV screens in the headrests. I looked around. I noticed a sticker encouraging me to connect to the in-flight wi-fi. That would do it, I thought. A site like FlightRadar would answer my little man’s question, down to the nearest few meters.\nBut unfortunately for him I’m the creator of PySkyWiFi (“completely free, unbelievably stupid wi-fi on long-haul flights”). Not paying for airplane internet is kind of my signature move. We’d need a different, offline strategy.\n\nI had a think. When you connect to an airplane wi-fi network, you’re usually met with a payment page where you can purchase access to the internet. The page also usually gives you the same flight information that you’d find in the back of your headrest, like speed, direction, and estimated flight length. Perhaps it would have a map as well, I thought.\nI pulled out my laptop, connected to the network, and loaded up the payment page. It did indeed show our wind speed, direction, and estimated time of arrival. But no map.\n(It didn’t occur to me to screenshot the page so here’s an artist’s impression)\n\n“Maybe the server that’s sending us this data is actually also sending us our location, but the web page isn’t displaying it,” I thought. I opened up the Chrome developer tools. I saw that my browser was making regular requests to a /info endpoint.\n\nI clicked on one of the requests. This /info endpoint was indeed sending us a huge pile of data, including fields for ground_speed, wind_speed, and estimated_arrival_time. At the bottom of the response I noticed fields for latitude and longitude. My heart leapt. But then I looked closer. They were both null. Aerofoiled.\nThis looked like the end of the line. I was about to give up and tell my son that we were somewhere just north of Italy, probably…Europe ...",
