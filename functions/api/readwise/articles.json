The new Speculation Rules API enhances performance by allowing browsers to prefetch or prerender pages based on user behavior, leading to nearly instant navigation. Combining these approaches creates a smoother browsing experience with reduced delays and faster content loading.",

This happens in content systems too, like Kindle's Popular Highlights, where most highlights come from the beginning of books. To improve this, readers should focus on later chapters, authors should provide value early, and designers should create systems that highlight important content throughout.",
